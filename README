Notes from the meetup:

We wrote a capistrano deploy script and got kittybase up on sameerchowdhury.com

kittybase.sameerchowdhury.com

We got image upload to work with paperclip by installing the imagemagick package through yum.

We're using apache reverse proxying to standalone passengers.  Here's the kittybase virtualhost config:


<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot /home/dpflaster/rails/kittybase/current/public
    ServerName  kittybase.sameerchowdhury.com
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:9001/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:9001
</VirtualHost>

We also discussed what project we want to work on as a group.  We've decided on a beer check-in and review site 
using maps.
